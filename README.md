# Knock-A-Rodent
Welcome to my Knock a Rodent game project! This is a fun and interactive game that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to whack as many moles as you can within the allotted time.

[Live Demo](https://knock-a-rodent.netlify.app/)

# How to Play

To start the game, simply click on the "Start" button. Rodents will then appear randomly from their holes, and you have to click on them with your mouse to knock them down. Each rodent you hit will earn you one point. You can pause and resume the game in between. Your high score will also be displayed there. The game ends when the time runs out, and your final score will be displayed on the screen. You will have two options there, either you can quit thr game or start a new game. 

# Game Controls

The game is played entirely using your mouse. To whack a rodent, simply click on it with your mouse. There are no keyboard controls for this game.

# Game Features

# What I Learnt fromt this project

I deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation by learning about concepts such as SetInterval, setTimeout, clearInterval, window.scrollTo and callback functions. Moreover, I also acquired the knowledge of adding background music using JavaScript, as well as the ability to control playback functions such as play, pause, and restart.
